## Description

The purpose of this Study Guide was to create a webpage using basic principles of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. By going through these exercises, I was able to practice coding with different languages and undestand a little more of how they work together and the processes to deploy them.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
